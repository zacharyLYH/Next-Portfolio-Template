        aboutMe:
            "I am a soon-to-be fresh grad with an undergraduate degree in BS Computer Science in May 2023 and would have close to 9 months of professional Software Engineering experience. \
         I am a natural leader; I have played key roles and led many projects during my internship, and I also tend to gravitate towards leadership/managerial roles in school and personal projects because people see me as a knowledgeable software engineer, a compassionate leader, a dependable team-player, and a result-driven individual. \
         I am extremely passionate about learning; I believe learning is what makes a good life a great life, and what separates the best among the big talent pool. \
         I work hard; I usually have no problem being the first person to start a day‚Äôs work, and the last person to end the day, however, that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt work smart ‚Äì I work hard, smartly ‚Äì and that has been the secret to all my career success.",
